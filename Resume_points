Designed and developed interactive dashboards using Google Analytics and Looker Studio at Adani One. These dashboards effectively tracked key performance indicators (KPIs) 
and identified trends, while also communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders

Developed a content generation model using GPT-4 API and integrated LLMs via Langchain framework, leveraging output parsers for efficient content creation.\
Employed the multimodal CLIP model to evaluate aesthetic scores and categorize images for the Adani One website 

Designed and implemented a content generation model using the GPT-4 API, seamlessly integrating LLMs through the Langchain framework. 
The model featured three hierarchical levels of content, each building upon the other. Additionally, I optimized the code to produce unique descriptions
with an ideal balance of burstiness and complexity

Successfully implemented the multimodal CLIP model for image classification and further refined an aesthetic scoring system to curate and select optimal
images for the Adani One website.

Detected inconsistencies in data sources and implemented robust data validation and reconciliation, resulting in a 40% reduction in data issues.
